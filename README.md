# Docker Fullstack Template

This project is a ready-to-use fullstack template that leverages Docker Compose to seamlessly integrate Nginx, React, FastAPI, and MariaDB. It provides a modern, production-like environment for rapid development and deployment of web applications with a clear separation between frontend and backend services.

## Features

- **Frontend**: Built with React, offering a fast and modern user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by FastAPI, providing a robust and flexible API layer.
- **Database**: Uses MariaDB for reliable and high-performance data storage.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx serves as a reverse proxy, efficiently routing traffic to the appropriate services.
- **Dockerized**: All services are containerized and orchestrated with Docker Compose, ensuring easy setup and consistent environments across development and production.
