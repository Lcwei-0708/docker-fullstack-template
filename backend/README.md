# Backend - FastAPI

This backend project is built with modern Python technologies to provide a robust, maintainable, and scalable API service.

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ and full async/await support.
- **SQLAlchemy (Async)**: Powerful and flexible ORM for database operations, using async engine and sessions.
- **Alembic**: Database migrations tool for SQLAlchemy.
  _See [Migration Docs](./migrations/README.md) for details._
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **Redis (Async)**: Used for rate limiting, integrated via `redis.asyncio`.
- **Uvicorn**: Lightning-fast ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.
- **Docker**: Containerization for development and deployment.
- **uv**: Fast Python package and project manager (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`).
- **Asyncio**: Native Python async event loop for high concurrency and performance.
- **Testing**: Pytest (asyncio, coverage); fully isolated environment with a dedicated test database.
  _See [Test Docs](./tests/README.md) for details._

## Lint

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and dev dependencies (`uv sync`).

```bash
cd backend
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

Auto-fix:
